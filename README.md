## Repo structure:
This was more or less created following this blog post: https://paulfioravanti.com/blog/2018/02/08/connecting-elm-to-phoenix-1-3/

I skipped the `create-elm-app` part because it seemed unnecessary for us.

## Elm auto-formatter with VSCode:
Install the elm-format tool by running the following command:
```sh
  npm install -g elm-format@exp
```
Then, make sure you've got the following setting in VSCode:
```json
"editor.formatOnSave": true,
```

## Phoenix autogenerated README stuff:

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
